# This is IBM agile HONORS project 

## Project Scenario
In this scenario, i will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, i will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, i will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, i will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. 

My team has been asked to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. My stakeholders need the ability to create products, retrieve products, update products, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for the ability for customers to indicate that they "like a product and have the site display the like count on the product page.‚Äù In addition to the catalog functionality, they have asked that it be hosted on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 

My team will use ZenHub to provide a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, i will be driving the process. I need to leverage the skills i learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and ZenHub kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become my user stories. 

## For this project
I will create an Agile plan with ZenHub. I will write user stories, build and refine the product backlog, build a sprint plan, move stories on the kanban board, set up a burndown chart, and get ready for the next sprint. 

## This is my kanban board
